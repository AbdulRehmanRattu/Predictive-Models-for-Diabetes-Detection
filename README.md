# Predictive Models for Diabetes Detection

## Project Description

This repository hosts the implementation of several machine learning models to predict diabetes using a dataset of health-related features. Models include a Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), along with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

## Dataset

The dataset, `diabetesdataset.csv`, consists of health-related features like age, gender, smoking history, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

## Models

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

Each model is evaluated using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

## Requirements

Python libraries required for this project are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

- Clone the repository and install dependencies.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook `project.ipynb` to train and evaluate models.

## Results

Model evaluations show the effectiveness of each model in predicting diabetes with detailed accuracy scores and classification reports provided in the notebook.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed for each model, with details provided on the optimal settings and their performance enhancements.

## How to Run

1. Install Python and necessary libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook project.ipynb
   ```
